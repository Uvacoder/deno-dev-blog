# About Craig's Deno Diary

Welcome to my blog! I'll be blogging about the JavaScript and TypeScript runtime
[Deno](https://deno.land). I intend on publishing new blog posts once a month.

I'm hoping to evolve the blog with new features and improved code quality as
time goes on. Source code can be found in this repo:
[https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-blog](https://github.com/cdoremus/fresh-blog).

If you are interested in receiving updates on new blog posts, please follow my
twitter feed [@deno_diary](https://twitter.com/deno_diary). Also, DM me if you
have any suggestions and ideas for this blog. I look forward to hearing from
you.
